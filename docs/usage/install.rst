Installation
============

This part of the documentation covers the installation of ltapy. The
first step to using any software is getting it properly installed.

Get the source code
-------------------

ltapy is hosted on GitHub, where the code is always `available
<https://github.com/fellobos/ltapy>`_.

Clone the public repository to get a local copy of the source:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git://github.com/fellobos/ltapy.git
    $ python setup.py install

Once you have it, you can embed ltapy in your own Python package, or
install it into your site-packages easily:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ltapy
    $ python setup.py install
